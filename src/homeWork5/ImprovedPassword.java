We should write a program to check password by following steps

1 - > If the string doesn't have any upper case
      letter or any lower case letter print
      "Your password is not acceptable"

2 - > If the first character of the password is upper case letter and
      the last character of the password is not letter print
      "Your password is strong".

3 - > If first character of the password is lower case letter and
      the last character of the string is upper case print
      "Your password should be improved"

4 - > For all other conditions print
      "Your password is not valid"

For this task you should use if else statement and no for loop.


Good Luck !
