/*
For this problem ask user to enter three numbers.
Round an int value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more,
so 15 rounds up to 20. Alternately, round down to the previous multiple of 10 if its
rightmost digit is less than 5, so 12 rounds down to 10. Given 3 ints, a b c, return
the sum of their rounded values.

Ex:1
Input1: 16
Input2: 17
Input3: 18
Output→ 60
round_sum(12, 13, 14) → 30
round_sum(6, 4, 4) → 10
E
x:1 Inpu
t
1: 1
2 Input2: 13 Input3: 18 Output→ 6
